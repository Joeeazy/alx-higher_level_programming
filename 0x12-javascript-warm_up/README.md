# General

* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
    
    JavaScript is versatile, allowing for both front-end and back-end development. Its asynchronous nature makes it powerful for handling tasks without blocking execution. It's also widely supported and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

* How to run a JavaScript script

    JavaScript can be run in a web browser by embedding it within HTML or in standalone environments like Node.js. You can execute a script file using the node command in a terminal.

* How to create variables and constants

    Variables are declared using var, let, or const keywords, while constants are declared using const. Variables can hold changing values, while constants hold fixed values.

* What are differences between var, const and let

    var is function-scoped, let is block-scoped, and const also creates block-scoped variables but cannot be reassigned.

* What are all the data types available in JavaScript

    JavaScript has several data types including primitive types like strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols, as well as non-primitive types like objects and functions.

* How to use the if, if ... else statements

    These are conditional statements used for decision making in code execution. if checks a condition, and if it's true, executes a block of code. else is used for executing code when the if condition is false.

* How to use comments

    Comments in JavaScript are used to explain code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the JavaScript engine. Single-line comments start with //, and multi-line comments are wrapped between /* and */.

* How to affect values to variables

    Values are assigned to variables using the assignment operator =.

* How to use while and for loops

    while loops execute a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true. for loops execute a block of code a specified number of times.

* How to use break and continue statements

    break is used to exit a loop prematurely, while continue is used to skip the current iteration and continue to the next iteration of the loop.    

* What is a function and how do you use functions

     Functions are blocks of reusable code. They can take input parameters and return values.

* What does a function that does not use any return statement return

    A function without a return statement implicitly returns undefined.

* Scope of variables

    Scope defines the accessibility of variables. JavaScript has function scope and block scope.

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

    Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic operations on numbers. These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), increment (++), and decrement (--).

* How to manipulate dictionary

    JavaScript does not have dictionaries, but it has objects which can be used similarly. Objects are collections of key-value pairs.

* How to import a file

    In Node.js, you can use require() to import files. In the browser, you can use module systems like CommonJS or ES modules.
